This is to fill in a few cracks I have about managing my Github packages. 

Namely:

- npm releases
- CI
- commit strategy
- testing workflow
  - I'm familiar with TDD but the constant shifts in landscape have left me uneasy
  - In this repo I will:
    - Adopt a new Jest based strategy
    - after first starting with Mocha and Chai
- code coverage
- commit hooks
- adding browser builds
